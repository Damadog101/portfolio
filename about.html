              Principles medallion Throughout my two years of middle school, I
              did my best to get the best grades I could in all my classes. In
              the end, my effort was rewarded, as I earned the Principal's
              Medallion medal for maintaining straight A’s throughout all of
              middle school.

              Talent Show Award In 10th grade, I participated in the school
              talent show. In my left hand, I solved a Rubik’s Cube, while in
              the right, I juggled the ball around the cups of the kendama. From
              my performance, I was able to win the 3rd place prize out of about
              ten to twelve performances.

              Rubik's Cube Award At the most recent math competition I attended,
              there was also a Rubik’s Cube race. I participated, and while it
              was my first competition, I was able to secure the first place
              prize with a three solve average of about thirteen seconds.

          Skill toys Skill toys are one of my favorite things, and I am almost
          never without one. My main 3 skills of choice are speedsolving Rubik's
          Cubes, using kendamas, and juggling. Kendama is my oldest hobby, and
          has shown the most improvement. We all start by just barely catching
          it on one cup, but I have improved my skill to be able to juggle it
          around, balance it in unique spots, and finish by catching it on the
          spike. Rubik's Cubes are more recent, but most familiar to the average
          person. I average 12 seconds a solve, with a best of 7.12. In addition
          to this, I can solve them blindfolded, and have grown my collection to
          about 100 Rubik's-like puzzles. Lastly is juggling, which I took on to
          combine my other skills together. As stated, I can juggle the parts of
          a kendama to perform more creative tricks. However, I have taken it a
          step further, being able to juggle and solve Rubiks Cubes at the same
          time.

          Gaming Like most people my age, I greatly enjoy video games. I am
          overall a Nintendo supporter, with my favorite series being the Mario
          and Metroid series, and my favorite game being Super Mario Galaxy 2.
          However, I have more recently been trying out some other kinds of
          games, and have come to greatly enjoy Subnautica, Just Dance, and
          Minecraft.

            In five years, I see myself attending my final year at 4 year
            college. I will have transferred from Clovis Community after 2
            years, to finish my 4 years somewhere else. I am currently unsure
            where this will be, but it likely will be somewhere that has good
            courses related to web or game design. I may still have a small side
            job at fast food, however I may also have a part time job in web
            development. I would still live with my parents, and it would likely
            be the last year I do so. I would be researching and/or applying to
            larger jobs during this year, planning to get a career in the
            future.
