          <p>Skill Toys</p>
          <!-- <p>
						Skill toys are one of my favorite things, and I am almost never
						without one. My main 3 skills of choice are speedsolving Rubik's
						Cubes, using kendamas, and juggling. Kendama is my oldest hobby, and
						has shown the most improvement. We all start by just barely catching
						it on one cup, but I have improved my skill to be able to juggle it
						around, balance it in unique spots, and finish by catching it on the
						spike. Rubik's Cubes are more recent, but most familiar to the
						average person. I average 12 seconds a solve, with a best of 7.12.
						In addition to this, I can solve them blindfolded, and have grown my
						collection to about 100 Rubik's-like puzzles. Lastly is juggling,
						which I took on to combine my other skills together. As stated, I
						can juggle the parts of a kendama to perform more creative tricks.
						However, I have taken it a step further, being able to juggle and
						solve Rubiks Cubes at the same time.

          <!-- <p>
						Like most people my age, I greatly enjoy video games. I am overall a
						Nintendo supporter, with my favorite series being the Mario and
						Metroid series, and my favorite game being Super Mario Galaxy 2.
						However, I have more recently been trying out some other kinds of
						games, and have come to greatly enjoy Subnautica, Just Dance, and
						Minecraft.

          <p class="lightBox">
            In five years, I see myself attending my final year at 4 year
            college. I will have transferred from Clovis Community after 2
            years, to finish my 4 years somewhere else. I am currently unsure
            where this will be, but it likely will be somewhere that has good
            courses related to web or game design. I may still have a small side
            job at fast food, however I may also have a part time job in web
            development. I would still live with my parents, and it would likely
            be the last year I do so. I would be researching and/or applying to
            larger jobs during this year, planning to get a career in the
            future.
