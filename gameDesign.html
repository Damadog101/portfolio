						The first project I worked on during my game design class was using
						a software called SMBX. This works pretty much the same way as the
						official Nintendo game, Super Mario Maker, however it has its own
						unique features. The purpose of this project was to get used to
						making your own game, without having to worry about the difficulty
						of programming. Because this means the project is more focused on
						design, rather than development, I struggled a bit. I prefer the
						programming side of game development, and perform better when
						someone gives me a design to make. Nonetheless, I was still able to
						make a fun, challenging game that I am proud of, and it was a good
						introduction to game development.

						Our first big project, one that my teammates and I actually had to
						program to make, was called Codename: Holly. This was a game
						inspired by Jurassic Park, where the player controls a dilophosaurus
						named Holly. Holly is kept inside a dinosaur battle arena, and must
						battle other dinosaurs to escape. This game was a very interesting
						experience, as it challenged my ability to work as a team, as well
						as push my programming skills. My team was chosen for me, so not all
						of us knew each other well, and we had some issues with
						communication. In addition to this, I was made the lead developer on
						the project, even though there was another team member who was much
						more experienced in programming. While these issues made the
						experience a difficult one, I was able to persevere, improve my
						skills, and produce a successful product.

						My final big project in my game design class was called Beowulf's
						Inertia, and was made in Unreal Engine. This game was inspired by
						the epic poem, Beowulf, which describes a story where Beowulf, a
						Geatish warrior, battles 3 monsters to save Denmark. This idea
						translated to the game I developed, as the player controls Beowulf,
						and must save Danish villagers from the same 3 monsters in the book.
						This project was another team project, where me and another
						programmer each took half of the game to develop. I was tasked to
						create the hub world of our game, as well as all the abilities for
						the player. This was a very big challenge, considering my lack of
						experience, as well as the fact that Unreal Engine has a great deal
						of features to learn. Even so, I was able to learn a lot about
						Unreal Engine, and I created a game I am very proud of.
