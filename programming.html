						This was the first website I created, the DelveHomes project, and
						the difference in quality to my current work shows my progress as a
						web developer. My partner and I were tasked with creating a
						homebuilders website for a company named DelveHomes, which
						advertised the fictitious homes described in the story, The Machine
						Stops, by E. M. Forster. We learned in this project to make mood
						boards with Canva and wireframes with Figma, both in order to plan
						our website. It was also in this project that we were introduced to
						Github, which we used to sync and save our code. Lastly, we used
						Netlify at the end of the project to host our website. Being it was
						our first project, we faced many challenges, the largest one being
						positioning. We were very new to Flexbox, which is the way we were
						taught to position objects in CSS, so we had to communicate and do
						research in order to make sure everything was programmed properly.
						In reflection, the work was not my highest quality. However, it did
						teach me how to write better CSS, especially flexbox, which I use on
						a daily basis when developing websites.

						This is the 2nd website I worked on, which I called the Showcase
						Project. In this project, I described how an individual person could
						help to conserve water. While I conducted all the research and wrote
						all the content myself, the programming phase was where the big
						twist that my instructor put on the project came in: we would not be
						able to touch our computer during the programming phase, but rather
						we would be guiding our fellow classmates to do it for us. This
						greatly tested and improved all of our communication skills, as we
						would have to give in depth descriptions of our goal in order to
						succeed. I began by creating detailed wireframes with Figma, as well
						as mood boards with Canva, in order to better convey my information
						to my peers. The programming phase started soon after, and I learned
						how to use Github’s commit messages, in order to label everyone’s
						contributions on our IDE, Visual Studio Code. Looking back on the
						project, I now see that the days with less experienced classmates
						ended up being the most beneficial. While not only testing my
						communication skills in explaining what I wanted done, it also
						tested my teaching skills. I was not the best of the class at the
						time; however, I understood many of the concepts that others did
						not. This led me to teach my peers these concepts on the days we
						worked together, which in turn gave me a better understanding of the
						concepts myself. These concepts include flexbox, CSS media screens,
						and button functionality, all of which I use often as a developer.

						This was my Web Layout Practice project, in which my instructor
						assigned a PDF layout, and we were tasked to recreate the whole
						thing, pixel perfect, in code. To start, I began by taking note of
						all the colors of the website, extracting them for use in styling. I
						then initiated the development process, creating a Github Repository
						to work in and hosting it on Netlify, before developing both the
						HTML and CSS of the website in Visual Studio Code. This project
						tested my attention to detail and flexbox skills, as any part of the
						website different from the layout would dock points. One specific
						challenge I ran into was with background images. I was new to
						background images at the time, so learning to position them was
						difficult. However, I did my research and persisted through the
						problem to learn of background properties such as “cover”, which
						helped make the website as close to the layout as possible. In
						reflection, this project was beneficial in developing my previous
						HTML and CSS skills. It also taught me some small tags and
						properties, such as the "textarea" HTML tag or “cover” CSS property,
						both of which I keep in mind today for my work as a web developer.

						This website was my Budget Calculator project. Prior to the project,
						our class was visited by an employee of EECU who gave a presentation
						about taxes, budgeting, and more. Part of his presentation involved
						a section where we had to do calculations to discover our salaries
						after taxes, which was where our new project came in: we would
						recreate this part of the presentation online, creating a budget
						calculator that does all the hard work for us. While we did have a
						good idea of the design from the presentation, I created a Figma
						wireframe to plan out how I wished to design the website, which was
						broken into 3 parts. The first contained a list of around 60 jobs,
						each with their respective salaries. These could be plugged into the
						second section of the website, which would calculate the gross
						monthly income, tax deductions, and net monthly income. Lastly, the
						3rd section was a budgeting section, where you input your deposits
						or withdrawals to see your new balance. This was the first website I
						developed after learning JavaScript, so the logic was a challenge to
						write. I had to collaborate with my peers, as well as doing my own
						research to figure out how to create a working calculator. The main
						challenge I ran into for this website was with the budgeting
						section, where the goal was to have a new row be created after the
						previous row was full. The solution my peers and I found was to use
						JavaScript Classes, a new concept to me at the time. While it was
						difficult to create a working class, I persisted through the
						struggle, watching tutorials in order to make sure the website
						worked on time. This effort proved to be beneficial, as I ended up
						developing a successful project now hosted on Netlify, and I would
						be able to take this newfound knowledge to develop my future
						projects which involved many JavaScript Classes.

						This was a partner project we called Tic-Tac-Toe 2.0, where we
						recreated Tic-Tac-Toe with new rules, in order to make it more
						difficult, fun, and interesting. We began by brainstorming ideas on
						a Figma wireframe on how to layout the game, before creating a
						Github repository and hosting it on Netlify. We then began coding in
						Visual Studio Code, starting with the base HTML and CSS before
						moving onto JavaScript. This project in particular was a big
						struggle, as it required a lot of JavaScript to complete, and we
						were still new to the language. We had to use outside of the box
						thinking to develop a functional game, which required daily
						collaboration and in depth communication. One specific challenge we
						ran into was that the game was having trouble tracking wins, as it
						was returning many games as a draw that weren’t supposed to be. Due
						to the time it took for us to run through an entire game, it became
						a bit frustrating trying to figure out what the bug was, as it took
						a long time to be able to check results. Nonetheless, we kept a
						positive attitude and persisted through the problem until it was
						solved. Looking back, the main thing I took away from this project
						was having a more in depth understanding of JavaScript classes. In
						addition to this, I also developed more experience with event
						listeners, and learned about JavaScript dictionaries.
